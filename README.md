# Printf Project - ALX Group Project

This is a group project where we are expected to create our own custom `printf()` function in C programming language i.e `_printf`. 

The objective of this project is to deepen our understanding of the C programming language, especially the use of pointers and string manipulation.


### We are allowed to use the following authorized functions and macros:

1.  `write`
2. `malloc`
3. `free`

**SEE VARIADIC FUNCTIONS :)**
-   `va_start`
-   `va_end`
-   `va_copy`
-   `va_arg`
